# Android Password Manager Overview

This Android app allows the user to enter a website, username, and password and then stores those values for the user to view later after the user presses the add password button. The user can then press the view passwords button to view all of the websites they have passwords for. They can then input the website that they saved the password for and press the view passwords button and it will display the username and password for that website.

This was my first time creating an app so I decided to create a simple Android password manager app so I can learn the basics in order to create more complex apps in the future. It was really interesting to learn the basics of Kotlin and Android Studio for this project and I look forward to learning more complex features in the future.

# Development Environment

I used Android Studio which has an easy to use user interface to create Android Apps as well as an Emulator to run the app.

I used Kotlin for the app and used the default libraries Android Studio add when I first created a basic project. I also used Toast to display messages to the user in a simple way
